    [!] CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod "Firebase/Analytics":
      In Podfile:
        firebase_analytics (from `Flutter/ephemeral/.symlinks/plugins/firebase_analytics/macos`) was resolved to 11.3.5, which depends on
          Firebase/Analytics (= 11.4.0)

    Specs satisfying the `Firebase/Analytics (= 11.4.0)` dependency were found, but they required a higher minimum deployment target.
